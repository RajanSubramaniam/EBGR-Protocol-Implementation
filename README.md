# EBGR- Protocol Implementation in C++
  EBGR - Edge Node Based Greedy Routing  
  
# Problem Definition
  Implemented EBGR-(Edge Node Based Greedy Routing) algorithm in c++ programming language.The roouting algorithm is used to 
  find the optimum node within a particular transmission range in a wireless Vehicular Ad-hoc Network Scenario.

#Key Notes
  <ol>
    <li> Implemented the core logic of EBGR routing protocol.</li>
    <li> The relevant node in that particular transmission range is selected using a cosine similarity measure.</li>
